   - `career_advisor`: Provides personalized career guidance
   - `schedule_generator`: Creates custom preparation schedules
   - `interview_preparer`: Generates interview questions and feedback

### API Architecture

Built with FastAPI, featuring:

```python
# Main agent workflow setup
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Agent nodes configuration
workflow.add_node("supervisor", supervisor_agent)
workflow.add_node("document_improver", document_improver)
workflow.add_node("job_searcher", job_searcher)
workflow.add_node("career_advisor", career_advisor)
